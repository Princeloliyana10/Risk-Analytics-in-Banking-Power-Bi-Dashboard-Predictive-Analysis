# 🏦 Risk Analytics in Banking
### 📊 Power BI Dashboard + 📈 Predictive Analysis with Python

This project helps banks and financial institutions analyze and minimize loan default risks using powerful data visualization and Python-based analytics. It combines a Power BI dashboard with a Jupyter Notebook for back-end data processing.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Banks face challenges in assessing loan applicants and managing risk. The goal of this project is to analyze multi-dimensional client data and provide actionable insights that help decision-makers minimize financial risk.

---

## 💡 Solution

Using Power BI and Python:
- Integrated multiple client and banking datasets using primary/foreign keys
- Performed feature engineering: engagement days, income bands, processing fees
- Built DAX-based KPIs and calculated measures in Power BI
- Created a predictive Python notebook for EDA and risk modeling

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Power BI (Visual Dashboards, DAX, KPIs)
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- MySQL (Data source)
- Git & GitHub (Version control)
- PyCharm (Python development)
